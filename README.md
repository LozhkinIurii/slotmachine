# Slot machine app.

The application represents casino slot machine. All interactions are made in terminal. However, odds are not configured in the same way as in real slot machines. The main idea is to make same functionality, which is:
- player can deposit money
- player can bet money on multiple lines
- player can make spins
- player loses money (most likely)
- player wins money (very less likely)
- player can deposit even more money during game if not enough (not good for your wallet)

**To start the game run the *main.py* file in IDE or in command line type *python3 main.py* (for older versions  *python*), or *./main.py***

PS. Money is not real in this game.
